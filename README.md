# DynamicWallpaper
Initially wrote in Summer 2019, this project was my first dive into JavaFX and utlizing Swing to create a GUI. The application can be utilized through the command line, and on the initial run it will allow the user to undergo a setup to choose desktop photos for certain time periods. This configuration is saved for future use and setup is only required once (When config.properties exists, so to choose new photos simply delete the file).

Notice: Currently only compatible with MacOS (and maybe certain distros of linux, although this has not been tested), windows or other non-unix based operating systems will not work.
